# UKHED

## The grumpy giant

Ukhed is a giant who lives in a cave, mostly keeping to himself and complaining about the general happiness of those around him.  He doesn't like to move around much.  Sometimes, the little trickster Mooflor will convince him to come out of his cave and to cause mischief.  This will work for some time, until Ukhed inevitably gets bored and wants to return to the comfort of his cave.

His emoticon is `>:[`.
