#	DUB DUB

## Wielder of the power to disco!

Dub Dub was a lieutenant in the Discotecan army. Though his rather unorthodox means of combat were often instrumental to victory, they were looked down upon by superior ranking officers who believed a proper soldier would prefer a sword or spear. This prevented him from advancing to further rank, but he was highly respected by the Happies.

Whenever Sies, Erty, and Pootems were called away from the capital on errand, they appointed Dub Dub to watch over the city in their absence.

His emoticon is `:P`.
