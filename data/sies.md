# SIES

## The spirit of merriment and uppercase lettering.

Sies (pronounced 'seize') is the spirit of Happy, and is the chief spirit of the Happies. He is always happy, and spreads Happy across the land, but is not prone to spreading too much Happy, as Erty often does.

In fact, it is Sies who must occasionally tell Erty that he is spreading too much Happy, and that he should give it a rest for a little bit. Too much Happy is dangerous, and Sies understands this better than the rest of the Happies.

His emoticon is `:D`.
