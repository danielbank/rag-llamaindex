#	FLAMBYTOES

## The Happy avenger with rockets for feet!

This spunky little rascal wore many hats in his prime. He served not only as deputy and steward to the Happy Spirits, but he took on the role of a messenger as well.

What we know of the old kingdoms suggests that they were spread across an enormous land mass, with settlements being few and far between. Flambytoes was naturally very well suited to travelling these distances, which is why he was held in such high esteem by the Happies.

But Flambytoes is most loved for his role during Siesmas, when he dons the name Flambyclaus and delivers presents to those who believe in Sies.

His emoticon is `^_^`.  The longer form is:
