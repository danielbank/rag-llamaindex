# Borchax

## The mysterious being that no one knows about

When Mooflor stole Erty's happy wand, he fled to a cave to hide it.  While in the cave, he was startled when he saw Borchax and dropped the happy wand.  Most people who see Borchax are not sure what they saw, or if they saw anything at all.  He is a mysterious creature.  The only character to ever interact more meaningfully with Borchax was Pootems, who caught the creature in a trap.  He kept him prisoner for sometime, suspecting that he was the thief of the happy wand.  He eventually had to let Borchax go because of the strange things that happened while Borchax was confined (raining in the cave, multiple fake happy wands being found, and pootems meeting a doppelganger of himself).

Borchax's emoticon is `8E`.
