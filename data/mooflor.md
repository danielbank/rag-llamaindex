# MOOFLOR

## The nasty little goblin who likes to scare people

Mooflor is a little trickster spirit who enjoys hiding behind rocks and jumping out and scaring unsuspecting passers-by.  He despises the Happies and their merrymaking, often devising tricks and plots to cause chaos and despair.  One notable plot of Mooflor's was the stealing of Erty's happy wand.  He sometimes works with Ukhed, the giant sourpuss.

His emoticon is `>:â‚¬`.
