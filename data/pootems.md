# POOTEMS

## Keeper of the sacred word that makes our enemies cry!

Though Erty may be the right hand of Sies, Pootems is his middle finger! Pootems is guardian of the sacred word, :•, whose use is reserved for only the foulest of angries. When he uses the word, you know we mean business!

Woe unto our enemies who must bear witness to the awesome power of the word, as it has yet to fail us!

Many feel sorry that Pootems must be burdened with such a dark power, but we are all extremely grateful. For his services and protection, we give offerings of cookies and milk during our holiest of holidays, Siesmas.

His emoticon is `:•`.
