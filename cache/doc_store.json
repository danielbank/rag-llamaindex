We will look at some of the minor characters who figure into the story and provide a little background on them. First up is the Ergonoid Spearsman, a guardian of a nomadic group of people who shun all outsiders, happy and angry alike. Ergonoids are an aquatic people spending half their lives on land and half their lives in the sea. They make their temples at a depth of fifty meters which they free-dive to in order to observe their rituals. A master of the trident and other polearms, the Ergonoid Spearsman can easily dispatch a foe with his weapon on land and in water. On the spectrum of happy and angry, the Ergonoids are neutral. The Ergonoid Spearsman’s emoticon is B|.\\n\\nSalazar the Lonely Hermit was once a happy lord whose lands consistently brought plentiful harvests. One day the Angries blighted his lands and Salazar lost his favorite flowers. Although the Happies restored his land to its original bountiful nature, Salazar still mourned his favorite flowers that were lost. Unable to become happy again, Salazar retreated into the mountains to mope in solitude. On moonlit nights, he emerges from his cave to cry soulfully while he watches the night sky. Salazar was designed by Ryan Herriman, one of the first Siesians. The emoticon of Salazar is u_u.\\n\\nSource\\n\\n1/3\\n---\\nDub Dub the Warrior of the Dance is an ally of the Happies. His power is such that he never tires of dancing, which he uses to lure his enemies into dance competitions that rage for days until they inevitably collapse of exhaustion. Dub Dub was once a vain practitioner of the dance, seeking only to advance his own reputation. Flambytoes showed him the error of his ways and from then on, Dub Dub has been an upright individual. His emoticon is naturally :P.\\n\\nKing Giffle the Sad Monarch is ruler of a large realm yet still he is constantly plagued by the belief that his countrymen secretly hate him. Living in fear of being disliked, he never makes any decrees nor does he arbitrate in any matters. Instead, King Giffle stays holed up in his castle, sulking and wondering why people hate him. In truth, his subjects do not hate him and think he is a considerate if ineffective king. In some aspects, King Giffle could be compared to Ukhed because of his brooding. The difference however is that Ukhed blames others for his predicament while King Giffle is always introspective. The emoticon of King Giffle is :&lt;.\\n\\nKing Giffle the Sad Monarch\\n\\nWumbley the Captain of the Indifferent Pirates is not a seeker of adventure, though he likes such monikers. He leads his band of pirates from island to island with the constant promise of treasure and mischief-making. Every time the opportunity arises, however, Captain Wumbley decides to take a nap instead. Usually his men decide to go off without him, which Wumbley does not mind as much as he pretends to. Fiercely independent but without motivation, Captain Wumbley and his pirates could be considered allies of the Angries but they are far too undependable. His emoticon is :|.\\n\\nRoarlor the Hideous Swamp Creature lives in a swamp close to the high seas. Although he is a solitary creature, Roarlor is nonetheless a kind being and a friend of the Happies. He is also quite powerful, especially in the swamp where he camouflages with the green plant matter. On rare occasion, Roarlor will leave the swamp to help his allies. When he does, his appearance usually scares the\\n---\\n5/19/24, 8:46 PM More of the Sies | The Boogar Chronicles denizens of the land of Sies.

The character was called Sies (pronounced ‘SEES’ as in ‘ she SEES you’, If you can’t tell already, his emoticon is :D (a big smile). There was something appealing about the simplicity of Sies, so I created more characters based on other emoticons. The characters were divided into two distinct groups, the Happies and the Angries. Minor characters were also developed, but by this time the trend was starting to die off. The rest of this post will discuss the various Happies and Angries.\\n\\n|||\\n|---|---|\\n|Erty the Happy is happy like Sies but taken to such an extreme that it sometimes can be a problem. In his possession is the Happy Wand, an artifact that radiates pure joy. The Angries are constantly plotting ways to steal the wand and hide or destroy it. If not for the watchful eye of Pootems, such a dastardly deed would have already transpired. Erty’s happiness is best utilized rejuvenating the lands after they have been blighted by the Angries. In times of peace, his happiness can be a liability because it becomes over-abundant and out of control. The emoticon of Erty is also :D.|Erty the Happy|\\n\\nhttps://danielpbank.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/sies/ 1/3\\n---\\nPootems the Judgemental is the keeper of the sacred word that makes the enemies of the Happies cry. Although he is ranked among the Happies, Pootems is nonetheless very serious and judgmental. He is the judge and punisher of the Angries. Diminutive in stature, Pootems is nonetheless one of the most powerful beings in the realm in both strength and cleverness. For this reason, Pootems is the adviser of the Happies. Pootem’s emoticon is :o.\\n\\nFlambytoes the Adventurous was originally a minor character and not part of the Happies. However, he became a very popular character due to his shape, emoticon, and nifty rocket feet. Thus Flambytoes came to be part of the Happies. Flambytoes is the fastest character. He is also the only character with the ability to fly and is often seen as a messenger of the Happies, conveying their messages to others and reporting back news of the realm. Of all the Happies, Flambytoes is the most faithful in his service to Sies. The emoticon of Flambytoes is ^_^.\\n\\nMooflor the Scary is small like Pootems and almost as powerful and clever. He might be considered the leader of the Angries due to his propensity to cause unhappiness. Mooflor’s favorite hobby is to hide along commonly-traveled roads and jump out to scare people as they pass by. When not scaring people, Mooflor plots mischief against the Happies, such as stealing Erty’s Happy Wand. His emoticon is &gt;:€.\\n\\nUkhed the Angry is the largest being in the realm and also the most angry. Fortunately he is also quite lethargic and seldom acts on his anger. Instead Ukhed broods in his cave and curses others for behaving in ways that he feels are an affront to him. Ukhed is dim-witted and selfish, only doing things that he thinks will please himself. None of these things turn out to bring Ukhed much pleasure though and, in the end, he finds himself back in his cave blaming others because he is not happy. When Ukhed is motivated enough to join Mooflor’s cause, he can be a powerful ally and their mischief-making usually is successful for a time. Ukhed’s emoticon is &gt;:[.\\n---\\n# Sies | The Boogar Chronicles\\n\\nBorchax the Mysterious is the least seen and least understood of the characters. Some might count him among the Angries because of his inherent creepiness and love of dark places. Really though, Borchax is neither angry or happy because he is too mysterious to be pinned down. He is the manifestation of risk, gambling, chance, and the double-slit experiment. Borchax tends to show up when he is least expected and his appearance causes profound changes in any story, though always indirectly and never because of anything he has purposefully done.

He is a mysterious creature.  The only character to ever interact more meaningfully with Borchax was Pootems, who caught the creature in a trap.  He kept him prisoner for sometime, suspecting that he was the thief of the happy wand.  He eventually had to let Borchax go because of the strange things that happened while Borchax was confined (raining in the cave, multiple fake happy wands being found, and pootems meeting a doppelganger of himself).\\n\\nBorchax's emoticon is `8E`.\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/dubdub.md_0":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/dubdub.md_0\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/Users/DanielBank/workspace/rag-llamaindex/data/dubdub.md\",\"file_name\":\"dubdub.md\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"I6lgMyCfuHlcNVU0Y8BuPPS0KEZKmn6tdOu9oTvGjCw=\",\"text\":\"\\n\\n#\\tDUB DUB\\n\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/dubdub.md_1":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/dubdub.md_1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/Users/DanielBank/workspace/rag-llamaindex/data/dubdub.md\",\"file_name\":\"dubdub.md\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"hash\":\"Er9c8eVHj9Y0LbKpRJQ4ansdmsIoaOWvsnI23MJ+IiE=\",\"text\":\"\\n\\n## Wielder of the power to disco!\\n\\nDub Dub was a lieutenant in the Discotecan army.

We will look at some of the minor characters who figure into the story and provide a little background on them. First up is the Ergonoid Spearsman, a guardian of a nomadic group of people who shun all outsiders, happy and angry alike. Ergonoids are an aquatic people spending half their lives on land and half their lives in the sea. They make their temples at a depth of fifty meters which they free-dive to in order to observe their rituals. A master of the trident and other polearms, the Ergonoid Spearsman can easily dispatch a foe with his weapon on land and in water. On the spectrum of happy and angry, the Ergonoids are neutral. The Ergonoid Spearsman’s emoticon is B|. Salazar the Lonely Hermit was once a happy lord whose lands consistently brought plentiful harvests. One day the Angries blighted his lands and Salazar lost his favorite flowers. Although the Happies restored his land to its original bountiful nature, Salazar still mourned his favorite flowers that were lost. Unable to become happy again, Salazar retreated into the mountains to mope in solitude. On moonlit nights, he emerges from his cave to cry soulfully while he watches the night sky. Salazar was designed by Ryan Herriman, one of the first Siesians. The emoticon of Salazar is u_u. Source\\n\\n1/3\\n---\\nDub Dub the Warrior of the Dance is an ally of the Happies. His power is such that he never tires of dancing, which he uses to lure his enemies into dance competitions that rage for days until they inevitably collapse of exhaustion. Dub Dub was once a vain practitioner of the dance, seeking only to advance his own reputation. Flambytoes showed him the error of his ways and from then on, Dub Dub has been an upright individual.

In some aspects, King Giffle could be compared to Ukhed because of his brooding. The difference however is that Ukhed blames others for his predicament while King Giffle is always introspective.

Roarlor the Hideous Swamp Creature lives in a swamp close to the high seas. Although he is a solitary creature, Roarlor is nonetheless a kind being and a friend of the Happies.

The character was called Sies (pronounced ‘SEES’ as in ‘ she SEES you’, If you can’t tell already, his emoticon is :D (a big smile). There was something appealing about the simplicity of Sies, so I created more characters based on other emoticons. The characters were divided into two distinct groups, the Happies and the Angries. Minor characters were also developed, but by this time the trend was starting to die off. The rest of this post will discuss the various Happies and Angries. |||\\n|---|---|\\n|Erty the Happy is happy like Sies but taken to such an extreme that it sometimes can be a problem. In his possession is the Happy Wand, an artifact that radiates pure joy. The Angries are constantly plotting ways to steal the wand and hide or destroy it. If not for the watchful eye of Pootems, such a dastardly deed would have already transpired. Erty’s happiness is best utilized rejuvenating the lands after they have been blighted by the Angries. In times of peace, his happiness can be a liability because it becomes over-abundant and out of control. The emoticon of Erty is also :D.|Erty the Happy|\\n\\nhttps://danielpbank.wordpress.com/2013/09/09/sies/ 1/3\\n---\\nPootems the Judgemental is the keeper of the sacred word that makes the enemies of the Happies cry.

Of all the Happies, Flambytoes is the most faithful in his service to Sies. The emoticon of Flambytoes is ^_^. Mooflor the Scary is small like Pootems and almost as powerful and clever. He might be considered the leader of the Angries due to his propensity to cause unhappiness. Mooflor’s favorite hobby is to hide along commonly-traveled roads and jump out to scare people as they pass by. When not scaring people, Mooflor plots mischief against the Happies, such as stealing Erty’s Happy Wand. His emoticon is &gt;:€. Ukhed the Angry is the largest being in the realm and also the most angry. Fortunately he is also quite lethargic and seldom acts on his anger. Instead Ukhed broods in his cave and curses others for behaving in ways that he feels are an affront to him. Ukhed is dim-witted and selfish, only doing things that he thinks will please himself. None of these things turn out to bring Ukhed much pleasure though and, in the end, he finds himself back in his cave blaming others because he is not happy.
